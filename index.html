			Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively.
			 The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, 
			 and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system.[39] A significant feature 
			 of India's secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society.[citation
			  needed] </p>
				<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature
					of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain 
					skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing. A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to 
					secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.[41] Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan
					 (RMSA) which is the most recent initiative of Government of India to achieve the goal of universalisation of secondary 
					 education (USE). It is aimed at expanding and improving the standards of secondary education up to class X.</p>

		<p class="sectionTag text-big">Our Mission</p>
		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Manda University is a comprehensive online Christian University committed to educate, 
			disciple, equip, and empower students from throughout the world to impact the Global Christian Community (the Church).
			 We endeavor to create an academic environment that will produce powerful, Holy Spirit-filled leaders who will be 
			 influential in their God-ordained positions within marketplace, government, religion, education, community, and family.			
			 The National Literacy Mission (NLM) is a nationwide program started by Government of India in 1988 with the approval of 
			 the Cabinet as an independent and autonomous wing of the Ministry of HRD (the then Department of Education). It aims to 
			 educate 80 million adults in the age group of 15–35 over an eighty-year period. By "literacy", the NLM means not only 
			 learning how to read, write and count but also helping people understand why they are deprived and helping them move 
			 towards change.[citation needed] In India, 81% of youths from ages 15–24 and 63% of all adults are literate, based on 
			 a 2005–2010 UNESCO study.</p>
